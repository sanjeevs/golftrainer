# Introdction
This package provides a utility for analyzing a golf swing. The input data is represented as a json file
generated by [GolfTracker](https://pypi.org/project/golftracker/). 

The json file structure is represented by a data class "GolfData". A factory method is used to create it from the json filename.

The structure of the *GolfData* class is shown below.

## Development

Create a virtual env and then clone this directory.
Recreate the development env

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install the package locally

```
pip install -e .
```


## Installation
Install the package in your virtual env.

** This is still under developement. Not released yet. **

```
pip install golftrainer
```

## Demo
For this purpose we will use **data/00001.json** as an example. 

### Setup Jupyter Notebook
To make the notebook run under my virtual env (say 'venv'), follow the following steps.

```

pip install jupyter

```

Or for existing install create a new kernel.

```
ipython kernel install --user --name=venv

```

```
cd notebooks/demo

jupyter notebook demo1.ipynb 
```

Once we have the notebook the following commands we can use the GolfData object to access the parameters.


## Generated Data
Various sample golf swing videos shot down the line on a right handed golf player with the corresponding json file are stored in this [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TDUnGjP1wh1gZeN1EZdJOO4AeYuMLnkO?usp=sharing). 

Each video file (either a mp4 or mov) has 2 output files. The ".pkl" is the pickle database and ".json" is the file that we will use for this package to measure the various metrics associated with the swing.


Copies of the json file from google drive are checked into the data directory and has a corresponding notebook in notebooks/demo area.
